This solution demonstrates how to adjust PurgeCSS configuration to handle dynamically generated class names.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... other configuration
  purge: {
    content: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'], // Adjust paths as needed
    options: {
      safelist: [], // Add any classes that should always be included
      keyframes: true, // Preserve keyframes
      variables: true // Preserve CSS variables
    }
  },
  // ... rest of the configuration
};
```

In this updated configuration, the `safelist` allows you to add specific classes that should always be included in the final CSS bundle, even if they are not directly referenced in the main content files.  Additionally, `keyframes` and `variables` are enabled to keep CSS keyframes and variables, respectively. You may need to add your dynamically generated classes to the `safelist` or modify the `content` option to correctly detect them.
